The essay is very well written, both in terms of language and readability. We could not find 
any major structural issues, but here is a list of comments that you might consider to improve
the essay further.

-- Abstract

* The abstract summarizes the essay nicely without being too extensive.
* The sentence starting with "The conclusion" might be a bit too long.

-- 1 Introduction

* The first sentence does not seem to be connected to the following sentences.

-- 1.1 Defining Intelligence

* "in this essay is one from [1]" - is a bit confusing.
* "it is also seen" - A bit unclear what "it" refers to. Might be a good idea to
specify further.
* The section ends a bit abruptly. Since it seems like you are arguing that defining
intelligence is complex, a small conclusion might be relevant here to make it more
clear for the reader.

-- Eliza

* "The program detects if any of a given list of keywords" - Might need rephrasing.
* It had the benefit of being able to respond to statements in an “easy” way -
not quite sure what you mean by "easy".
* It has been enhanced in certain ways, however. - Might need rephrasing.

-- Testing Goostman

* "correctly answer" - answer correctly?

-- 3.4 Shortcomings of and Extensions to the Turing Test

* "creating a chat bot that can fool humans but it is not
 really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence."
 - Fooling someone takes intelligence right? Seems like this
 conclusion is not motivated from the previous sections.
 
 -- Conclusion
 
 * Very good and gets right to the point.
